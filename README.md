# Anomaly-Detection-in-network-traffic
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system for network traffic using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It involves collecting network traffic data, preprocessing it, and then applying various unsupervised learning algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM for anomaly detection. The evaluation of these algorithms revealed that Isolation Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and robustness to noise and outliers. This project contributes to enhancing network security measures by effectively identifying anomalies in network traffic data.
